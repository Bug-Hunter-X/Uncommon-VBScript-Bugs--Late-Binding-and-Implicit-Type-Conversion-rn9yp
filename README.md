This repository demonstrates two uncommon bugs in VBScript: issues arising from late binding and implicit type conversion.  The `bug.vbs` file showcases the problems, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides corrected versions with explanations.  These examples highlight the importance of explicit type checking and early binding in VBScript to prevent runtime errors and ensure reliable application behavior.
